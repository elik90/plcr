# plcr
PLaylist CReator

Purpose:<br>
Upload an .m3u8 playlist file to recreate in Spotify.

Elements:<br>
This solution started with pl_reader.py and was integrated into a django project to be the interface for playlist management. <br>
Spotify interaction is in test phases only and not fully incorporated to pull from playlist data.<br><br>

Once the data is uploaded to the webpage, a local SQLite DB is populated.
<br>
<br>
Project tasks remaining:
- Refactorization 
- Finalization of web interface
- Remote SQL setup
- Remote web hosting
- Spotify integration to web application
